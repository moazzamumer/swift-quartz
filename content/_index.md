        As a research assistant at FAST NUCES, I am engaged in research that explores forecasting, federated learning, and vision-language applications. My work includes developing methods for multivariate time series modeling and air quality prediction, where I experiment with advanced forecasting techniques and distributed frameworks.

        In parallel, I design federated learning pipelines for multi-sensor human activity recognition, enabling robust models to train across heterogeneous datasets while preserving privacy. I am also advancing domain-aware vision-language models, improving image captioning systems with cultural and contextual relevance. Collectively, these projects aim to build trustworthy, multimodal AI systems that connect research with real-world impact.

        I am open to collaborative opportunities in research and applied AI.
